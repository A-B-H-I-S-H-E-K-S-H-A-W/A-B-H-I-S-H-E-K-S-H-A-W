<h1> About Me </h1>
👋 Hey there! I’m Abhishek Shaw, a passionate Full-stack web developer. I thrive on turning coffee into code and building web applications that make a difference.

<h2>What I Do</h2>
Frontend Magic: I wield React like a wizard, crafting beautiful and responsive user interfaces. From components to hooks, I’m all about that client-side magic.
Backend Sorcery: Node.js and Express are my trusty companions. I conjure APIs, handle authentication, and dance with databases (MongoDB, anyone?).
Database Alchemy: MongoDB is my cauldron of choice. I brew schemas, mix collections, and stir in just the right amount of NoSQL goodness.
Deployment Spells: Heroku, Netlify, or AWS—I’ve got the incantations to deploy your app to the cloud.
<h2>  My Spellbook </h2>
🌐 Portfolio: Check out my portfolio website to see my latest enchantments.
📚 Blog: I occasionally scribble tech spells on my blog. Expect React rants and backend brews.
🎮 Side Quests: When I’m not coding, I’m probably battling dragons in Skyrim or exploring dungeons in Zelda.

📬 Shoot me an owl (or an email) at your.email@example.com. I’m always up for a chat about code, cats, or conspiracy theories (did you know JavaScript was invented by aliens? 🛸).

Remember, bugs are just mischievous gremlins—I’ll squash 'em for you! 🪲✨
